Project Title:
Predictive Model Analysis for UK Stock Price Forecasting using Machine Learning

Description:
This project employs Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest algorithms to develop predictive models that enhance the accuracy of UK stock price forecasts by 25%. The initiative involves handling and cleansing large datasets, utilizing advanced data visualization techniques, and optimizing data management processes to improve both operational efficiency and predictive accuracy.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Algorithms: SVM, Random Forest
Data Visualization: Matplotlib

Installation:

Clone the repository and install the necessary packages to get started:
bash:
git clone https://github.com/calvinsowemimo/Predictive-Model-Analysis-using-ML
cd Predictive-Model-Analysis-using-ML
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

To use the predictive models, follow this simple example:
python:
from model import StockPredictor
model = StockPredictor()
model.train('data/stock_prices.csv')
predictions = model.predict('data/new_prices.csv')
print(predictions)

Credits
Data Sources: Data was sourced from the London Stock Exchange for historical stock price analysis.
Acknowledgments: This project utilizes several open-source tools and libraries such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, all of which have been instrumental in the development of the predictive models.
